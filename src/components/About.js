        <p>
          I’m a passionate full-stack developer with experience in building
          scalable and user-friendly applications. My work spans backend APIs,
          frontend UI design, and integration of modern technologies to deliver
          complete solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy solving complex problems and turning ideas into reality using
          clean and efficient code. Whether it’s designing a system’s
          architecture or fine-tuning UI/UX details, I approach every task with
          dedication and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I love exploring new tools, contributing to open
          source projects, and learning about emerging trends in technology.
